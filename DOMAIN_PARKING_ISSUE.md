# Domain Parking Issue - apnajourney.com

## üö® Problem Identified

Your domain `apnajourney.com` is currently showing a **parking page** instead of your actual website. This means:

1. The domain is registered but not properly configured
2. The website is not pointing to the correct server
3. DNS settings are incorrect or pointing to a placeholder

## ‚úÖ What You're Seeing

The parking page shows:
- Generic "Parked by Domain.com" or similar message
- No actual website content
- This is a temporary placeholder provided by the domain registrar

## üéØ Solutions to Fix This

### Step 1: Check Your Deployment Status

#### Option A: Deployed on Cloud Run / GCP
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Check Cloud Run services
3. Verify your service is deployed and running
4. Check the URL of your deployed service

#### Option B: Deployed on Vercel
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Check your project
3. Verify deployment status
4. Get the deployment URL

#### Option C: Local Development Only
If you haven't deployed yet, you need to deploy first!

### Step 2: Configure DNS Settings

Your domain needs to point to where your website is actually hosted:

#### For Cloud Run / Google Cloud:
```bash
# You need to map your domain to Cloud Run
# Follow: https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/mapping-custom-domains
```

#### For Vercel:
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard:
# 1. Go to your project
# 2. Settings ‚Üí Domains
# 3. Add apnajourney.com
# 4. Follow DNS configuration instructions
```

---

### Step 3: DNS Configuration

You need to add these DNS records at your domain registrar:

#### If using Cloud Run:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: ghs.googlehosted.com

Type: A
Name: @ (or blank)
Value: [Cloud Run IP]
```

#### If using Vercel:
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Step 4: Update Domain Registrar

1. Log in to your domain registrar (where you bought apnajourney.com)
2. Go to "DNS Settings" or "DNS Management"
3. Delete any existing A records or CNAME records
4. Add the new DNS records (from Step 3)
5. Save changes
6. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

## üîç How to Check Current Status

### Check 1: Where is your site actually running?

Run this command to see if the site is deployed:
```bash
# Check Cloud Run
gcloud run services list

# Or check local deployment
npm run dev
```

### Check 2: Test your actual deployment URL

Your site might be running at:
- Cloud Run: `https://apna-journey-[hash]-[region].a.run.app`
- Vercel: `https://apna-journey.vercel.app`
- Local: `http://localhost:3000`

**Test these URLs to see if your site is working**

If you haven't deployed yet:

```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Deploy to Cloud Run (if using GCP)
gcloud run deploy apna-journey --source . --region us-central1

# OR Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Action 2: Get Your Deployment URL

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
- `https://apna-journey-xyz123.a.run.app` (Cloud Run)
- `https://apna-journey.vercel.app` (Vercel)

### Action 3: Configure Custom Domain

**For Cloud Run:**
